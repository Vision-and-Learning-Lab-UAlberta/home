Hamid is a Ph.D. student in the Vision and Learning lab at University of Alberta, working under the supervision of Dr. Li Cheng and Dr. Xingyu Li. His research focuses on developing high-fidelity human simulations using real-world capture data. This involves leveraging techniques in perceptual and generative AI. Prior to his doctoral studies, Hamid studied his master's and bachelor's in artificial intelligence and computer engineering. He also gained valuable industrial experience as a computer vision engineer, where he worked on real-time deep learning-based products for visual human analysis.
