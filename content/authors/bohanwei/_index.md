Bohan Wei is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Alberta, supervised by Dr. Li Cheng. She holds a B.Sc. in Forestry Protection from Northeast Forestry University, China, and M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Plant Science from the University of Alberta, Canada. She has over seven years of research experience with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) in Lethbridge, focusing on plant disease diagnostics, molecular biology, and genomics. Her research spans NGS-based DNA extraction, SNP analysis, GWAS for disease resistance in Canadian wheat, and fungal pathogen characterization. Her current interests center on AI-enabled plant disease detection, precision agriculture, and data-driven approaches for sustainable crop production.
