I obtained my Masters degree in Computer Vision and Machine Learning from the University of Alberta where I was advised by Prof. Li Cheng. I have publications at top conferences such as ICCV and EMNLP, and five years of experience in machine learning. Two of the tools that I worked on are being used in a practical setting. Please check my [personal website](https://tkbadamdorj.github.io/) for the latest details.
